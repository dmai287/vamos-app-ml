# VAMOS Mobility App - Machine Learning Analysis

This repository's Machine Learning (ML) section is dedicated to driving strategic recommendations for enhancing the VAMOS Mobility App's user engagement and infrastructure. VAMOS is an urban mobility platform that provides real-time data on various transportation modes, helping users navigate public transit, cycling, carpooling, and more. The ML component aims to support VAMOS in optimizing transit placement, growing user traffic, and personalizing app interactions.

## Machine Learning Objectives
The ML models are designed with the following goals in mind:

- Identify optimal locations for new transit stations based on user demand patterns.
- Generate strategies to increase app traffic and improve customer engagement.
- Enhance user segmentation to enable targeted, data-driven engagement strategies.
- 
## ML Models and Approaches
1. Station Location Recommendation:

- Objective: Recommend optimal locations for new transit stations to address user demand and reduce transit gaps.
- Methodology: This model employs clustering algorithms such as K-Means and density-based clustering (DBSCAN) to identify high-traffic areas. By analyzing location and route data, it uncovers hotspots and underserved regions.
- Outcome: A prioritized list of suggested station locations, each selected for high accessibility potential and impact on transit convenience.

2. Customer Engagement and Traffic Forecasting:

- Objective: Predict user growth and design strategies to increase app traffic, using insights into peak times and user behavior.
- Methodology: This involves time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to model traffic trends and seasonal patterns, alongside classification algorithms to pinpoint the most effective engagement channels.
- Outcome: Strategic insights into feature prioritization, in-app notifications, and targeted marketing to enhance user acquisition and retention.

3. User Segmentation and Personalization:

- Objective: Segment users based on engagement and transit mode preferences, allowing VAMOS to personalize recommendations and interactions.
- Methodology: Using clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means, hierarchical clustering), this model groups users into segments like daily commuters, occasional users, and tourists. Additional analysis identifies key - preferences within each segment.
- Outcome: Tailored engagement strategies, such as commuter-specific incentives or targeted promotions for new users, to boost retention and satisfaction.

4. Key Outcomes and Applications
- Location Optimization: Recommended station placements based on data-driven insights to improve accessibility and reduce transit gaps.
- Enhanced Engagement Strategies: Data-informed suggestions for marketing and engagement that align with user behavior and traffic trends.
- User-Centric Personalization: Targeted feature updates and promotions for different user segments, driving both immediate and long-term user growth.
